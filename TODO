Before release:

1. SSH to friends page
2. Convert printToTerminal to handle the chat page as well as the chat box
3. Display an alert when we need to use printToTerminal but the user isn't in
   a chat window or page and we can't display any feedback.
3. Switch to next open chat box on minimize/exit
4. Reliable authentication for posting

Backlog:

1. Handle friend name collisions
2. Options page (for things like history size)
3. Autocomplete
